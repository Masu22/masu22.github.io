# まさか！

The Japanese expression **「まさか！」** can be translated into English as:

* **"No way!"**
* **"It can't be!"**
* **"You're kidding!"**
* **"Impossible!"**

It's often used to express **shock, disbelief, or surprise** when something unexpected happens or is suggested. The exact translation depends on the context and tone.

**Example:**

* A: 彼が犯人だったんだよ。

* B: まさか！

* A: *"He was the culprit."*

* B: *"No way!"* / *"It can't be!"*

Let me know the context if you want a more tailored translation!
